# Database migrations

Every `.sql` file the production database depends on lives in this directory or
in `migrations/`. **Nothing outside the repo.**

## Why that sentence is here

Until 2026-08-30, SQL lived in three places: this directory, and two untracked
sibling directories outside the git root (`restaurant-cost-system/supabase/` and
`restaurant-cost-system/migrations/`, 14 files between them). The repo root is
`app/`, so `git log` could not see either one.

The result was that nobody could tell what had been *written* from what had been
*run*, and three separate bugs traced back to it — code calling a schema object
that never existed:

- `app_settings` — `getQFactorPct()` silently returned a hardcoded 3
- `schedule_notes` — schedule notes appeared saved and vanished on reload
- `swap_supplier_order` — an RPC that never existed, so its unchecked fallback
  ran on every supplier reorder while looking like the handled path

All 14 files were moved in here. If you write a migration, it goes in this
directory, and it gets committed whether or not you have run it yet.

## Two numbering series — both historical

`migrations/` contains two independent series that were never reconciled:

| series | files | origin |
|---|---|---|
| `0001`–`0005` (four digits) | init, q_factor, price history, recipe history, POS aliases | the original schema |
| `004`–`012` (three digits) | SOP module, roles, owner guards, inventory orders, stations, maintenance, two-stage approval | added later, in the other directory |

They do not collide by filename and neither is a renumbering of the other. Left
as-is rather than renamed, because the numbers appear in commit messages and
`HANDOFF.md`. **Do not start a third series** — new files get a descriptive name
(`<feature>_migration.sql`) in this directory, as everything since 012 has.

## Applied status

Verified against production on 2026-08-31 by probing every table, column, view
and function declared across all 42 files.

**Applied: everything.** All tables, columns, views and functions declared
across the 42 files exist in production.

`app_settings` and `schedule_notes`, listed here as unapplied until
2026-08-31, have both landed. `purchase_cost` was widened to numeric(12,4)
and `menus.fuel_cost` was dropped on the same day.

### Not applied

| object | file | status |
|---|---|---|
| `pos_receipt_deliveries` backfill | `scripts/backfill-pos-deliveries.mjs` | The table and `pos_import_settings` exist and are empty. Nothing in `src/` reads or writes them yet — the Path 2 persistence is still unimplemented. |

### Removed rather than applied

`ot_rules` was declared in `hr_migration.sql`, never applied, and referenced by
no code. The declaration, its policies, its seed rows, and the matching policy
block in `hr_role_patch.sql` were deleted rather than run.

## Lint is not green, so the write-check rule is not CI-enforced

`local/no-unchecked-supabase-write` (in `eslint-rules/`) catches the class of
bug behind most of this file's history: a Supabase write whose error is
discarded. It works, and reports zero violations today.

It cannot gate CI yet. `npm run lint` still reports **9**
`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` problems across 7 components — the catering
charges editor, the daily accounting entry, the ingredient manager and others.
Those are the prop-resync pattern; fixing them properly changes real UI
behaviour and needs someone clicking through each screen, so they were left
deliberately rather than downgraded to manufacture a green run.

Until they are fixed, the rule protects only what someone remembers to look
at. Do not add `--quiet` or lower the rule severity to get around this.

## Ceilings this system runs into

Written down because the last one — Vercel's request-body limit — cost a day
of debugging that a note would have saved.

| ceiling | value | where it bites | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Vercel request body | **4.5 MB**, not raisable by tier or config | a POS `.xls` posted to a Server Action. Rejected *before* the function runs, so it surfaces as "An unexpected response was received from the server" with nothing in the logs | being fixed: parse in the browser, upload validated rows in chunks |
| `serverActions.bodySizeLimit` | 15 MB (set in `next.config.ts`) | Next's own limit. **Not** the one that bit us — it is well above Vercel's | fine |
| Vercel function duration | **90 s** | `buildPosImportPreview` reads a delivery window and recomputes the preview. Bounded today by `pos_import_settings.window_days` (90), so a few thousand rows | fine, but this is the next wall of this kind. If the window grows, move the aggregation into SQL rather than raising anything |
| `npm run lint` not green | 9 `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` | blocks CI enforcement of `local/no-unchecked-supabase-write` | open, see below |

## Where two changes actually landed

Two pieces of work were folded into commits whose messages do not mention
them, because whole files were staged that already carried pending edits.
Recorded here so searching for them finds something:

| change | landed in | commit subject |
|---|---|---|
| **POS 4dp** — `newCost` rounded to 4 decimals instead of 2, paired with `purchase_cost_4dp_migration.sql` | `c6ea9a7` | "Let admins run the POS price import, and stop silent logouts" |
| **schedule_notes cleanup** — removed the `eslint-disable`, checked `upsertScheduleNote`'s write and `getScheduleWeek`'s read | `3df70cd` | "Delete the leave approve/reject path that was never wired up" |

## Verifying applied status yourself

A table or column: request it and read the error code.

```
GET /rest/v1/<table>?select=*&limit=1     PGRST205 = table absent
GET /rest/v1/<table>?select=<column>&limit=1   42703 = column absent
```

Do **not** use `head: true` for this — a missing table can come back as
`{ count: null, error: null }`, which reads as success.

Functions are harder, and two traps cost real time:

- **Trigger functions are invisible over REST.** Anything `RETURNS TRIGGER` is
  not callable via `/rpc/`, so it returns `PGRST202` whether or not it exists.
  Confirm those by their *effects* instead (does the history table have rows? is
  `updated_at` diverging from `created_at`?).
- **PostgREST resolves by name *and* parameter list.** Calling `/rpc/<fn>` with
  `{}` returns `PGRST202` for any function that takes arguments — which looks
  identical to the function being absent.

And do not call an unfamiliar function against production just to see whether it
exists. `next_catering_quote_seq` allocates and returns a sequence number; a
probe of it wrote a junk row that had to be deleted. Read the definition in this
directory first.
